# web-txt-database-system
<p>Suitable for warehouse use.</p>
<br />
<p>This program allows you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>create delete or modify records (id, content, type, place)</li>
  <li>search for records</li>
  <li>check your record data</li>
  <li>upload images to records</li>
  <li>automatically gerenates a QR code to records when added</li>
  <li>password protect the modification tools (default: admin - admin)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The records must be stored in a txt file in the same directory on a web server.</p>
<p>There are ten records added as an example.</p>
<p>The id.txt file works with my <a href="https://github.com/Bence542409/c-database-system">C# database system</a>.</p>
<p>The files are in Hungarian, but you can change it as you like.</p>
